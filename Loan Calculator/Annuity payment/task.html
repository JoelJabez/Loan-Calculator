<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Let's compute all the parameters of the loan. There are at least two kinds of loan: those with annuity payment and those with differentiated payment. In this stage, you are going to calculate only the former. <strong>Annuity </strong>type of payment consists in paying a fixed sum of money at specified intervals, for example, each month or each year. The <strong>annuity payment</strong> amount is precisely this fixed sum of money that you need to pay at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Let's assume that annuity payments are made monthly. Thus, we can use the following formula to calculate the <strong>monthly payment</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(A_{ordinary\_annuity} = P * \dfrac{i * (1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}\)</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span> = annuity payment;</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span> = loan principal;</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> = nominal (monthly) interest rate. Usually, it is 1/12 of the annual interest rate and is a floating value, not a percentage. For example, if your annual interest rate = 12%, then i = 0.01;</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> = number of payments. This is usually the number of months in which repayments will be made.</p>
<p>So far, in this stage you are interested in four values: the number of monthly payments required to repay the loan, the monthly payment amount, the loan principal, and the loan interest. Each of these values can be calculated if others are known:</p>
<p><strong>Loan principal:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(P = \dfrac{A}{\left( \dfrac{i * (1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1} \right)}\)</span></p>
<p><strong>The number of payments:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="math-tex">\(n = \log_{1+i} \left( \dfrac{A}{A - i*P} \right)\)</span></strong></p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you should add new behavior to the calculator:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you should ask the user which parameter they want to calculate. The calculator should be able to calculate the number of monthly payments, the monthly payment amount, and the loan principal.</li>
<li>Then, you need to ask them to input the remaining values.</li>
<li>Finally, compute and output the value that they wanted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you have to ask the user to input parameters in a specific order which is provided below. Simply skip the value the user wants to calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is the loan principal (<code class="java">P</code> in the formulas). </li>
<li>The second is the monthly payment (<code class="java">A</code> in the formulas). </li>
<li>The next is the number of monthly payments (<code class="java">n</code> in the formulas).</li>
<li>The last is the loan interest. The user inputs the interest rate as a percentage, for example, 11.7. You should divide this value by 12 and 100 to use it as <code class="java">i</code> in the formula.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be careful converting "<strong>X months</strong>" to "<strong>Y years and Z months</strong>". Avoid writing "0 years and 11 months" (output "11 months" instead) and "1 years and 0 months" (output "1 year" instead).</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that this is not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>calculating the number of monthly payments</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">What do you want to calculate?
type "n" for number of monthly payments,
type "a" for annuity monthly payment amount,
type "p" for loan principal:
&gt; n
Enter the loan principal:
&gt; 1000000
Enter the monthly payment:
&gt; 15000
Enter the loan interest:
&gt; 10
It will take 8 years and 2 months to repay this loan!</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at <strong>Example 1</strong>.</p>
<p>You know the loan principal, the loan interest, and the monthly payment (annuity payment). You want to calculate the number of monthly payments. What do you do?</p>
<p>1) You need to know the nominal interest rate. It is calculated like this:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(i = \dfrac{10\%}{12 * 100\%} = 0.008333...\)</span></p>
<p>2) Now you can calculate the number of months:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(n = \log_{1 + 0.008333...} \left( \dfrac{15000}{15000-0.008333... * 1000000} \right) = 97.71...\)</span></p>
<p>3) You need an integer number, so let’s round it up. Notice that the user will pay the same amount every month for 97 months, and in the 98th month the user will pay<em> 0.71...</em> of the monthly payment. So, there are 98 months to pay.</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\(n = 98\)</span></p>
<p>4) Finally, you need to convert “98 months” to “8 years and 2 months” so that it is more readable and understandable for the user.</p>
