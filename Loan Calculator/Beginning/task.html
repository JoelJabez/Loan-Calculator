<p>Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes several parameters like a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.</p>
<p>Not familiar with these concepts? Don't worry, we will explain them to you in simple terms. The principal is the original amount of money you borrow. The interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated as a percentage of the principal amount.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>Let's start by imitating this behavior. There are some prepared variables in the source code: these are text messages that our loan calculator can output. In this stage, all you need to do is output them in the right order.</p>
<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Loan principal: 1000
Month 1: repaid 250
Month 2: repaid 250
Month 3: repaid 500
The loan has been repaid!</code></pre>
